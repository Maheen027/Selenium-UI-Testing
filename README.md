Selenium scripts testing real website elements
Selenium UI Testing involves using Selenium WebDriver to automate the interaction with real user interface (UI) elements on a live website. 

The scripts simulate actual user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, selecting dropdowns, verifying text, and navigating between pages. 
The main goal is to ensure that all elements behave as expected under real-world conditions. 
Selenium scripts interact directly with HTML elements like inputs, buttons, links, images, and dynamic components, validating their functionality, visibility, responsiveness, and performance.
This helps detect UI bugs early and improves the overall user experience.
